# Gravitational-Wave-Detection
This project explores the application of deep learning to detect gravitational waves, a pivotal aspect of astrophysics and cosmology. The study addresses the challenge of classifying strain wave data generated by events like black hole mergers and neutron star collisions. To ensure data clarity and usability, the raw strain wave data undergoes extensive preprocessing, including whitening to reduce noise and the Continuous Q-transform (CQ-transform) to convert time-domain signals into frequency spectrograms, capturing both time and frequency details.

Efficient data pipelines built with TensorFlow were employed to process large-scale datasets, handling the computational complexity of the project. A baseline convolutional neural network (CNN) was developed to establish initial classification benchmarks. Building on this, the project implemented EfficientNet B7, a state-of-the-art model architecture, which significantly outperformed the baseline by achieving an AUC score of 0.8754, demonstrating its capability to discern gravitational wave signals from noise with high precision.

The project also incorporated advanced visualization techniques, enabling the interpretation of spectrograms and model predictions. These insights were instrumental in refining the model and addressing challenges such as data imbalance and variability in signal characteristics. The results highlight the potential of deep learning to revolutionize astrophysical research, providing a scalable and accurate framework for analyzing large-scale gravitational wave datasets. By transforming noisy, complex data into actionable insights, this work contributes to the broader understanding of the universeâ€™s most dynamic events and opens doors for future applications in signal processing and astrophysic
